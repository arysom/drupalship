What can Drupal custom code do?

- Alter existing or add a new functionality
- Integrate with third party systems
- Provide new ways to manage, display or interact with content or users
- ...

Let's see which Drupal concepts are used to achieve this.

## There is a module for that! ™

Drupal is a modular system. It means that it is built from small pieces of code that can be enabled or disabled. 
These pieces of code are called modules.

One of the newcomer mistake is [programming too much](https://books.google.be/books?id=JrW9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73#v=onepage&q&f=false).
If you need to implement a rather common feature, chances are that there is a module for that, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

Here is a short list of the [most used modules](/build/modules-themes-distributions#modules). 

Drupal is also pretty well integrated with the PHP ecosystem ([Symfony](https://symfony.com/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) / [Packagist](https://packagist.org/), [PSR's](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/)) since version 8, so you can still find documentation outside of the Drupal scope.

OK, now it's really time to see what Drupal provides to build custom code.


## Hooks and events: react to changes

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that are called at a specific moment of the execution.
Modules are able to implement these hooks to alter the behavior of Drupal core or other contributed modules.

They are defined in the module's `.module` file.
For themes, they are defined in the `.theme` file.

#### How can I find which hooks are available?

For the core, hooks are defined in the [API documentation](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!core.api.php/group/hooks/).

A module can also define its own hooks. They are usually discoverable through the modules `.api.php` file.

A simple way to find hooks is to search for `hook_` in the codebase or just let PHPStorm autocomplete the function name for you when [Drupal is configured](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/drupal-support.html).
Then type your module name and PHPStorm will provide you with a list of available hooks.

#### Examples of hooks

##### `hook_form_alter`

This hook is called when a form is built. It allows to alter the form rendering and its state.
Has this hook has a pretty large scope, it is preferred to use more specific hooks when possible, like `hook_form_FORM_ID_alter` or `hook_form_BASE_FORM_ID_alter`.

##### `hook_entity_type_alter`

This hook is called when an entity type is defined. It allows to alter the entity type definition, for example to add a new field to all nodes.

##### `hook_entity_insert`

This hook is called when an entity is inserted in the database. It allows to react to the creation of an entity.
There are various other hooks like this one, for example `hook_entity_update` or `hook_entity_delete`.
Like `hook_form_alter`, it is preferred to use more specific hooks when possible, like `hook_ENTITY_TYPE_insert` or `hook_ENTITY_TYPE_update`.

### Events

Events are objects that are dispatched at a specific moment of the execution.
They are roughly similar to hooks, they are just implemented in a different way, that follows object oriented principles.
Hooks are still used in Drupal, because there is a lot of legacy code that uses them, but events are the recommended way to alter the behavior of Drupal Core
if it is possible to use them.

### Subscribers

React to events, like Symfony `RequestEvent`

### Dispatchers

Dispatch events, with `EventDispatcher`

## Services: provide reusable code

#### How can I find which services are available?

Here is a [List of core services](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/services/10)

Similar to hooks, PHPStorm shines here, especially with the Symfony plugin installed.

Drush can also do that: `drupal debug:container` then pipe it to `grep` to find a specific service.

## Routes: define URLs

### Structure of routes

Most of the time, the only thing that you need to do is to define a route in your module via a [.routing.yml](/develop/create-a-drupal-module#module-files) file.

Here is a very minimal example from the core Book module, that defines the route for a Controller method.

```yaml
book.render:
  # The path always starts with a leading forward-slash.
  path: '/book'
  # Defines the default properties of a route.
  defaults:
    # For page callbacks that return a render array use _controller.
    _controller: '\Drupal\book\Controller\BookController::bookRender'
  # Require a permission to access this route.
  requirements:
    _permission: 'access content'
```

Same goes for a form:

```yaml
my_module.route_machine_name:
  path: '/my_module/personal-info'
  defaults:
    _form: 'Drupal\my_module\Form\InfoForm'
    _title: 'Personal information'
  requirements:    
    _permission : 'custom_module_permission'
```

### How can I discover existing routes?

With Drush `drush route` or the [Devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel) module.

*And how can I find the current route used by the frontend.*

There are several ways to do that:

- Without any dependency (Drush, Devel, ...): implement a rather global hook like `hook_preprocess_page` and dump `\Drupal::routeMatch()->getRouteName()`;
- `drush route --path=/the-path`

[Read more about Drush route](https://www.drush.org/12.x/commands/core_route/)

### Alter existing routes

Useful e.g. to add a new access control or to change the controller method that is called.

This is rather straigthforward, you just need to implement a `RouteSubscriberInterface` and implement the `alterRoutes` method.

### Dynamic routes

[Read more](https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-apis/routing-system/providing-dynamic-routes) - Drupal.org

## Controllers and response types: return content

- Render array
- Response / cacheable response
- JSON response / JSON cacheable response
- Binary file response

## Content entities: manage content

### Core entity types

- Node: `node_types` are providing `node` content
- Taxonomy term: `vocabulary` are providing `taxonomy_term` content
- User

### Custom content entities

### Extend content entities



## Configuration entities: manage configuration

### Core configuration entities 

We already discovered some of them: node_types and vocabularies.

- `user_role` contains a set of [`permission`](#permission-system) configuration

### Custom configuration entities

### Extend configuration entities: third pary settings



## Forms: provide user interaction


## APIs: integrate with third party systems

### Consume APIs

### Serve APIs



## Migration: import data from other systems

This can be used to import data from a legacy system or to migrate from another CMS once.

But it can also be used to import data from a third party system on a regular basis.

### Import from another CMS or Drupal 7 site

Drupal 7 sites have their [own migration system](...), as version 8 introduced many breaking changes
in the model.



## Plugin: provide extensibility and extend existing systems

Plugin manager, plugin types, plugin discovery

### Field plugins


## Mailing: send emails



## Decorators: alter existing code



## Permission: define access to content and functionality

- Access handlers


## Caching


## Validation: use contraints
