# Patch a Drupal project

Patches can be provided by the community to deliver a fix or a new feature to a Drupal project.
The scope can be a core or contributed project patch.

On a Drupal.org issue, there are 2 ways to get a patch
1. Via a patch file, attached to the issue
2. Via a git branch / Merge request on GitLab

On the first case, you can just reference the patch file, locally or on Drupal.org via an absolute url.

For the second case, you should always download it as the Merge Request might evolve, so the codebase change is not set 
in stone. To download it locally, just append the .patch extension to the Merge Request url.

Example: 

For [this issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3086883) we have
- A patch file in the first comments, to demonstrate a POC, it could be referenced straight in your composer.json section https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2023-03-12/3086883-13.patch.
- A Merge request, you can download the patch from this URL https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/merge_requests/3642.patch
