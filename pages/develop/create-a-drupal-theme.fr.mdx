# Create a Drupal theme

<Callout type="warning">Section under construction.</Callout>

We will not focus on details here, but just have an overview of the two main methods to create a Drupal theme.

## Starterkit

You can use a default Starterkit or your very own, to be reused between projects.
The idea here is to not extend but just make a copy to start from so there is no need to worry if the source changes.
It's still possible to track source changes.

### Use the default Starterkit

Create it in the `themes/custom/my_theme` directory

```bash
php core/scripts/drupal generate-theme my_theme --path themes/custom
```

### Use a contributed or custom Starterkit

Replace `source_theme_name`

```bash
php core/scripts/drupal generate-theme --starterkit source_theme_name my_theme
```

## Extend a base theme

You take most of the base theme and add your own customizations.
Sub-themes inherit all the features of the base theme, the base can also inherit from another base theme.

In your `my_theme.info.yml` file, use the following line and replace the `base_theme_name`

```yaml filename="my_theme.info.yml"
base theme: base_theme_name
```
