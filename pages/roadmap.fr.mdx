# Roadmap

The roadmap is about overall documentation improvements, but keep the base small, so it's easy to maintain and we don't loose the purpose of this site: to be lightweight.

### New sections to come:

- Basic Drupal architecture for developers: concepts to know, how to create a minimal module and a theme
- Drupal prerequisites for developers: improve documentation for resources to learn PHP, Symfony, Twig, Composer, Git, ...
- Drupal project management and budget
- Deploy in production and environment best practices (robots.txt / headers, indexing, staging, CDN, ...)
- Short list of showcase describing various cases: commerce, decoupling, multilingual, ... so it's easy to find a good example to compare with other solutions

Updates are posted on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drupalship) and [Mastodon](https://drupal.community/@drupalship)
