## Small to medium projects

If VPS and Ansible is your thing, it might be the perfect fit.
Here are some general purpose hosting companies, not specialized in Drupal, but with a good price/value ratio and very good documentation, support and processes.

### A note about Ansible

By the way, if you plan to use Ansible, make sure to have a look at this fantastic book from Jeff Geerling [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/).
[Examples](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops) and the [manuscript](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops-manuscript) are open source and available on GitHub.
It saved me a lot of time not reinventing the wheel, if you like Jeff's work, consider buying the book or become a sponsor. 

## Medium to large projects

Comes with pre-configured dev, stage, prod or feature based environments, CI/CD integration, ...
These companies are specialized in Drupal hosting.
