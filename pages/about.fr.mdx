# About this project

This documentation is for Drupal newcomers and evaluators.

It aims to provide a starting point for anyone who wants to know a bit more about Drupal.

When using Drupal, you have the luxury to have too much information and documentation for basically anything that you want to throw at the CMS.
Great blogs, books, drupal.org, ... are a gold mine when you know where to look or just what to search.
But as a newcomer, it can be a bit intimitading. Even though the learning curve is known as steep, for most cases, you can already have an MVP rather quickly, if you know where to start.

## Questions that this documentation can answer

- [Is Drupal the right solution for my project?](/build/when-to-use-drupal) I want to quickly compare with other solutions and have arguments to convince (or not) my client, my manager... or myself 
- [I have 5 minutes today, is it enough to install Drupal?](/build/installation#fast-local-installation)
- As a site builder evaluator, [I have a few hours to spend on Drupal, what should I learn first?](/build/concepts)
- As a new developer, [which tools, best practices, Drupal concepts should I know about?](/develop/toolkit-for-drupal-developers)
- As a translator, writer, developer, ... [How can I contribute to Drupal?](/contribute/contribute-to-drupal)
- [Where can I meet Drupal people?](/meet/events)
- [Where can I find Drupal jobs or services?](/work/work-with-drupal)
- I'm ready to deploy! [Where can I host my site?](/deploy/drupal-hosting-for-evaluation-and-production)

## How it started

This project is a personal initiative that has no direct link with Drupal.org, apart from the inspiration that the community gives in my daily life.

It came from the observation that, as a developer coming from another stack, it took me some time and the luck to meet the right persons to be aware of the richness of the Drupal ecosystem and the people that make it live.

So, to take a programming analogy, this site intends to act like a [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) on the Drupal ecosystem.

## The name Drupalship

Being a Star Trek fan, I definitely wanted to bring a space reference here.

Another reason is that Drupal.org provides a blog aggregator on https://www.drupal.org/planet, so I also wanted to hold a reference to this well known resource that demonstrates how active the community is.
