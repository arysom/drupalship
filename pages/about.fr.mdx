# About this project

This website is a personal initiative that has no direct link with Drupal.org, apart from the inspiration that the community gives in my daily life.

Drupal.org is a gold mine of documentation when you know where to look but, as a newcomer, you can quickly be overwhelmed by the amount of contents and the learning curve.

It comes from the observation that, as a developer from another technology stack, it took me some time and the luck of meeting the right persons to be aware of the richness of the Drupal ecosystem and the people that make it live.

So, to take a programming analogy, this site intends to act like a [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) on the Drupal ecosystem.

## Goals

- Accelerate onboarding time by providing a starting point for newcomers adn reduce the documentation to the essential: tools, best practices, Drupal concepts and drupalisms, contribution, ...
- Quickly compare with other solutions and give you the arguments to convince (or not) your client, your manager or yourself
- Produce a maintainable documentation base, that could be eligible for translation

## The name Drupalship

Being a Star Trek fan, I definitely wanted to bring a space reference.

Well, the real reason is that Drupal.org provides a blog aggregator on https://www.drupal.org/planet, so I wanted to hold a reference to this well known resource that demonstrates how active the community is.
