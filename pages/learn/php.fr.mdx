## PHP Standards Recommendations (PSR's)

The PHP Standard Recommendation is a PHP specification published by the PHP Framework Interop Group. Similar to Java Specification Request for Java, it serves the standardization of programming concepts in PHP. The aim is to enable interoperability of components and to provide a common technical basis for implementation of proven concepts for optimal programming and testing practices. The PHP-FIG is formed by several PHP frameworks founders.

Each PSR is suggested by members and voted according to an established protocol to act consistently and inline with their agreed upon processes.
