## Need some help?

If you have an issue with a contributed project or the Drupal core, check the [issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/issue-queue) first.

All the Drupalistas from StackOverflow are on [Drupal Answers](https://drupal.stackexchange.com/) so if you have a question that is not already covered by the issue queue, post it there.

### But wait, there is more!

The Drupal community is also organizing [events all over the world](/meet/events), so there is always a place to meet 
and if you do not have the opportunity to move, check [Slack](https://drupal.org/slack).
