# Normalize your naming conventions

This is not Drupal specific, but it applies specifically to Drupal due to the freedom that it allows.

Drupal provides _label_ and _machine name_ (e.g. for content types _Article_ and _article_, _Basic Page_ and _page_).

Normalizing the way you are name content types, fields, vocabularies, roles, image styles, clean urls... have several benefits:

*   Improve reusability
*   Improve readability
*   Facilitate project onboarding for other collaborators

Here are some rules that can be easily adopted. It should be regarded as a first idea: read the rule then build your own.

## Fields

Fields are everywhere: content types, vocabularies, users, blocks, ... so let's start with that.

*   No entity type prefix, field names should remain short and could be used by another entity type (e.g. for a flag, do not use document\_status, but status).  
*   No plural, following the same rule than SQL tables (btw fields _are_ SQL tables). Multiplicity can change over time (e.g. not field\_files but field\_file).  
*   For entity reference, simply use the machine name of the reference (e.g. document\_type).  
*   For fields that are specialized by a module (e.g. Telephone or Link), use the name of the module machine name (telephone, link).

## Content types

Avoid to be too generic... or too specific.  
Being too generic will give a vague idea and could lead to hesitation from the author.  
Being too specific will lead to too many content types.

Provide a description for your content type first, the name will come by itself.  
  
_Example: Event_

## Roles

Roles should be defined from the use case of the website. Having personas will help here.

A community of authoring users could be defined by

*   Editor: person that can review and publish content
*   Author: person that can write content and send it to the editor

A real estate website could be defined by

*   Promoter: project manager of a building that can edit properties content.
*   Agency: sales representative that can edit sales status for properties.

*   _Image styles_
*   _Clean URLs_
*   _File directories from File or Image fields._
