# Installation of Drupal core and contributed projects

## Fast local installation

This is perfect to evaluate and develop with Drupal locally.
A 5 minutes tops installation. You should have PHP 8.1 and Composer installed.

### Require the project

```bash
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project my-site
```

### Install Drupal

```bash
cd my-site
```

There are 2 scripts: `install` and `quick-start`.

`quick-start` is a wrapper around `install` with some default shortcuts like running a local PHP server, opening the browser and logging you in as an admin.
We will show both options here, as it's good to know what's happening under the hood.

Installation with SQLite database and the standard profile.
This is perfect to test a vanilla Drupal installation and install a few modules to review.
Also this setup is the ideal candidate to debug a Drupal project issue in isolation and contribute.

```bash
php web/core/scripts/drupal install standard
```

Installation with the the Demo Umami profile.
It comes with some demo content, translations and a few other modules enabled. Use this if you want to evaluate Drupal features.

```bash
php web/core/scripts/drupal quick-start demo_umami
```

### Run it with the PHP built-in server

```bash
cd web
php -S 127.0.0.1:8888
```

### Install contributed projects

```bash
composer require drupal/[project_name]
```
Then enable the project with Drush or the UI.

#### Enable a project with the UI

- Modules /admin/modules
- Themes /admin/appearance

#### Enable a project with Drush

```bash
composer require drush/drush
drush en [project_name]
```

## Installation with DDEV and Lando

### A note about Docker on macOS

Docker for Mac is a great tool to run containers on your Mac. 
However, it is slow. Make sure to read this article:
