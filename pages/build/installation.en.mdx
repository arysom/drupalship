# Installation of Drupal core and contributed projects

## Fast local installation

This is perfect to evaluate and develop with Drupal locally.
A 5 minutes tops installation. You should have PHP 8.1 and Composer installed.

<div className="steps-container">

### Require the project

```bash
composer create-project drupal/recommended-project my-site
```

### Install Drupal

```bash
cd my-site
php web/core/scripts/drupal install standard
```

### Run it with the PHP built-in server

```bash
cd web
php -S 127.0.0.1:8888
```
</div>

### A note about Docker on macOS

Docker for Mac is a great tool to run containers on your Mac. 
However, it is slow. Make sure to read this article:
